Mega Air Man
====================
_**Author:** David Timmons ([http://david.timmons.io](http://david.timmons.io "Visit my website!"))_

_Mega Air Man_ is a game demo written in _Elm_ and based on the NES classic _Mega Man 2_. _Elm_ is a cutting-edge ML-style language similar to _Haskell_ that natively supports a functional reactive architecture in client-side Web applications.

## Features:

* Watch Air Man jump!
* Watch Air Man try to shoot his tornado gun! _Note: Mega Man stole the tornado gun..._
* Watch Air Man stop moving when he bumps against a wall!
* Watch the background clouds animate in high definition 8-bit movement!

## Dependencies (Development Only)

* [Elm:](http://elm-lang.org/ "See the Elm website.") Powers all application logic.
* [Sprity:](https://github.com/sprity/sprity "See the Sprity repo.") Creates the sprite sheet.
* [UglifyJS:](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/ "See the UglifyJS website.") Compresses JavaScript application files.
